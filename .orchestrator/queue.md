## Ready to build

None.

## Needs a person, hardware, or release authority

1. **macOS release signing** — supply the Apple secrets required by
   `RELEASING.md` §1 before the macOS release arm can run.
2. **AT-SPI journey (251)** — on a real Linux desktop with Orca, exercise
   document reading, caret/selection, overlays, and an editing burst.
3. **Linux drawn-menu Export click** — use a real window/compositor and confirm
   the rendered menu's Export action reaches its destination.
4. **Linux v0.10.0 artifacts** — launch both the tarball and AppImage on a real
   desktop; check launcher name/icon and the AppImage FUSE fallback.
5. **macOS Export as PDF panel (301)** — confirm initial folder/name and that
   Cancel leaves the document untouched.
6. **Live glide (284)** — judge the 20° travel tilt and whether wrapping needs a
   distinct flourish.
